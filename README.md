## ðŸ“Œ Background
In photochemical experiments, the same molecule may exhibit different behaviors (e.g., **Labile**, **Resistant**, or **Product**) across samples due to varying environmental conditions. This leads to **label conflicts** when training machine learning models. For example:
- *Molecule 1*: Labeled as `Labile` in Sample A but `Product` in Sample B.
- *Molecule 2*: Labeled as `Resistant` in Sample C but `Product` in Sample D.

Traditional single-network approaches fail to capture these contextual differences, resulting in poor generalization.

## ðŸš€ Solution: Dual-Network Graph Learning
We propose a **global-local graph neural network (GNN)** framework to resolve label conflicts by combining unsupervised global patterns and sample-specific local features.

### Step 1: Data Preparation & Network Construction
- **Irradiation Experiments**: 4 groups (8 samples: A1, A2, ..., D2) with FT-ICR MS analysis.
- **Global Network**: 
  - Unsupervised learning on all samples.
  - Links represent molecular reactions (e.g., `+CHâ‚‚`, `+Oâ‚‚`).
  - Captures universal patterns (e.g., common reaction pathways).
- **Local Networks**: 
  - One sub-network per sample (A1-D2).
  - Encodes sample-specific features (e.g., pH, light intensity).

### Step 2: GNN Representation
- **Global Embedding** (Skip-Gram):  
  Random walks generate molecule embeddings reflecting shared properties.
- **Local Feature Specialization**:  
  Enhances embeddings with sample context (e.g., `E4' = E4 + Mean(E1+E2+E3+E5)`).
- **Feature Fusion**:  
  `Average Pooling + Concatenate` merges global and local embeddings.

### Step 3: Model Validation
- **Classifiers**: Compared DT, DLNN, and XGB on fused embeddings.
- **Key Improvement**:  
  Local networks resolve conflicts (e.g., distinguishing "Molecule X" in Sample A vs. B).

## ðŸŽ¯ Results
- **Accuracy Boost**: Local features improved classification F1-score by **X%** (see `Results/Performance_Metrics`).
- **Case Study**:  
  *Molecule 1*: Correctly classified as `Labile` in Sample A and `Product` in Sample B after local feature integration.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Innovation
- **Dual-Network Design**:  
  Global network = "Encyclopedia" (general rules); Local network = "Diary" (sample-specific details).
- **Interpretability**: Feature specialization (e.g., height analogy) makes model decisions transparent.

## ðŸ”® Future Work
- Extend to other chemical analysis tasks (e.g., catalysis).
- Optimize local network granularity (e.g., per-condition vs. per-sample).
